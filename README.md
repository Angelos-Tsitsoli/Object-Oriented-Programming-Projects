# Exercises About Object Oriented Programming

<img width="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c02d8ec5-edfb-40c0-9def-16aabc997dcb">

This collection of exercises aims to reinforce foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Each exercise focuses on applying these principles to real-world scenarios, promoting an understanding of how OOP improves code structure, reusability, and maintainability.

# Exercise #1 (Library)
## Description
This exercise aims to practice the fundamental concepts of class composition, constructors and destructors, as well as the accessibility and scope of class members in C++. In this exercise, i was  required to implement a simulation of a library's functionality, which consists of a base, a cupboard, and three shelves. The cupboard contains two internal shelves, and each shelf hosts books. Each book includes its title, the author's full name, and its ISBN.
The library provides functionality for placing books on specific shelves, removing books from them, and printing the current status of the library with the books it contains. Each class has a constructor that prints related messages during the creation of the object (e.g., "a library is being created") and a destructor that prints messages when the object is destroyed.
